# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Welcome to my project on the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster challenge! This repository showcases my approach to building a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. By exploring and refining the dataset, I aimed to improve accuracy and derive valuable insights.

## Introduction
The project began with a careful examination of the provided dataset to enhance accuracy. This involved identifying missing data, such as null values, and excluding irrelevant columns like 'Passenger ID' for more accurate results.

## Data Insights Extraction
Valuable insights were drawn from the 'Name' column, focusing on courtesy titles like Mr, Miss, and Mrs. This led to the creation of a new "Title" column for improved analysis. Consequently, the 'Name' column was excluded, as it no longer contributed relevant information.

## Handling Missing Data
Addressing missing data was crucial for model performance. Missing values were filled with appropriate data. For example, missing ages were filled using the mean age for a given title. The challenge presented by the 'Cabin' column was also addressed to improve model accuracy.

## Data Transformation for Modeling
To prepare the data for machine learning, continuous values were transformed and categorical columns were mapped. Gender was converted to binary values (0 for male, 1 for female), while titles were numerically mapped (e.g., Mr as 0, Miss as 1, Mrs as 2, and others as 3).

## Model Evaluation
Evaluating model accuracy was a key step. The data was split into training and testing sets (65% for training, 35% for testing), excluding the target column from the latter. The training accuracy reached 82% using Support Vector Machine (SVM), the highest-performing model. In testing, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 77.76% on Kaggle.

This structured approach helped improve model performance and accuracy in the context of the Titanic machine learning challenge.
